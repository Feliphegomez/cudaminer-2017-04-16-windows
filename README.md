# Customize cudaminer for windows
This version extend from cudaminer which is best for Nvidia GPUs. I customize code to run cuda on maximum GPU performance <br/>
Step by step <br/>
1- Download cudaminer-2017-04-16-windows.zip file and unzip to the local driver <br/>
2- Run CUDAMINER-START.bat file in x64 or x86 folder (x64 for 64bit and x86 for 32bit version of the windows) <br/>
